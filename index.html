<section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a game technical artist with 10+ years of experience in Unity. I have expertise in designing and implementing the ‘Unity layer’ which links the art and animation of the game artists to the functionality of the programmers’ underlying codebase. I also have experience creating animations, particle effects, and custom shaders when necessary. My drive to solve problems in a thoughtful, elegant way has resulted in maintaining a high degree of polish and quality across all the games I have worked on.</p>
